# Overview
This time, a very simple challenge that I was able to complete in a short period of time. Similar to the previous challenge I did, I used flexbox to develop the layout, which is the layout I've been focusing on learning at the moment. I'm quite satisfied with the result, although I know I still have a long way to go.
